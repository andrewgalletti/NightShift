# NightShift
This is a game built for Software Development class at Macalester College.
The game play is simple: you are navigating through maps, there are ghost roaming around. Ghosts will chase you if you get close enough. Run from the ghost using arrow keys, get to the destination!
To get this game running on your computer, you need to install Android Studio, libgdx, and of course, Java. After you clone the project, run gdx-setup, and navigate to the directory of the cloned project. Then, open a Java SDE and run the DesktopLauncher in the project.
